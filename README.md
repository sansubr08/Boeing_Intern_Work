All Boeing Proprietary Information Has Been Wiped Out and only non identifable code has been uploaded with sometimes a phantom data set from chatgpt
Large portion of my internship involved statistical modelling of data to predict flight delays of the Boeing 787 - 
The "What type of Curve" code file simply determines what type of curve/distribution all the delay data follows most closely 
The "Cauchy Distrubution Parameters" code file is an attempt to categorize the predicitions for each airline operator into a Cauchy distribution curve and simply isolate the parameters of each airline operator (noted in an excel file)
