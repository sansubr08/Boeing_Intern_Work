All Boeing Proprietary Information has been wiped out and only non identifable code has been uploaded with sometimes a phantom data set from chatgpt.

Large portion of my internship involved statistical modelling of data to predict flight delays of the Boeing 787. This involves studying the theory, coming up with an approach on how to model the data, modelling the data with all the operator data, and then inputting the results on an excel sheet. 

The "What type of Curve" code file simply determines what type of curve/distribution all the delay data follows most closely. 
The "Cauchy Distrubution Parameters" code file is an attempt to categorize the predictions for each airline operator into a Cauchy distribution curve and simply isolate the parameters of each airline operator (noted in an excel file).
The piecewise modelling code plots and isolates every single data point from the tableau dashboard containing delay data (also noted in an excel file).
These statistical models were built based of 2015-2017 data and tested against 2018-2019 data.
